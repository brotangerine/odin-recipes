    <h2>Creme brulee is a treat that combines a wonderful texture experience.</h2>
    <p>This recipe will explain the process for making creme brulee at home, so you can enjoy the crunchy burnt sugar on top and the smooth custard underneath.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>  
     <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar, extra for topping</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>How to make:</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 325. In a saucepan combine cream, vanilla bean, and salt. Cook over low heat
            just until hot. Allow to sit for a few minutes, then discard the vanilla bean.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine egg yolks and sugar together until light and fluffy. Temper the egg mixture by pouring a small amount of the cream
            into the bowl. Once eggs have been stirred, combine the new mixture in with the remaining cream mixture in the sauce pan. Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place 
            them on a baking dish. Fill baking dish halfway up the sides of the ramekins with boiling water. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Once removed,
            allow them to cool completely in the fridge for several hours, or up to a couple days.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, top each custard with a small amount of sugar in a thin layer. Go over the sugar topping with a cooking blowtorch in circular motions until sugar begins to melt.
            Do this until the sugar melts and browns, but make sure not to burn it or overwork an area! Serve immediately once sugar topping has solidified.</li>
     </ol>
